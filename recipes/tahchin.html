    <h1>Tahchin</h1>
        <p1>Tahchin is a traditional Persian rice dish made with saffron-infused rice, yogurt, and eggs, often layered with chicken or lamb. <br> 
        This recipe focuses on the chicken version but also includes a vegetarian variation featuring stinging nettles. <br>
        It is layered and baked until there is a golden, crispy crust on the outside called tahdig. <br>
        The dish is usually served with barberries, pistachios, or almonds but I don't decorate it. Flipping it is spectacular enough. <br>

    <h3>Ingredients & Instructions</h3>    
    <h4>Outer Crust (same for both versions)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs - yolks only</li>

            <li>½ tsp saffron threads, bloomed in 2 Tbsp hot water</li>

            <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups rice (parboiled basmati or long-grain rice, partially cooked, needs to be slightly firm in the center aka al dente)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together egg yolks, yogurt, oil, bloomed saffron, salt, and pepper.</li>
