    <h1>Tahchin</h1>
    <p1>Tahchin is a traditional Persian rice dish made with saffron-infused rice, yogurt, eggs, and often chicken or lamb, and in this case with stinkging nettles too. <br> 
        It is layered and baked until there is a golden, crispy crust on the outside called tahdig. <br>
        The dish is usually served with barberries, pistachios, or almonds but I don't decorate it. Flipping it is spectacular enough. <br>
