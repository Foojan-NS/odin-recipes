    <h1>Tahchin</h1>

        <img src= "/Users/foojan/odin/odin-recipes/tahchin.jpeg">

        <p1>Tahchin is a traditional Persian rice dish made with saffron-infused rice, yogurt, and eggs, often layered with chicken or lamb. <br> 
        This recipe focuses on the chicken version but also includes a vegetarian variation featuring stinging nettles. <br>
        It is layered and baked until there is a golden, crispy crust on the outside called tahdig. <br>
        The dish is usually served with barberries, pistachios, or almonds but I don't decorate it. Flipping it is spectacular enough. <br>

    <h3>Ingredients & Instructions</h3>    
    <h4>Outer Crust (same for both versions)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs - yolks only</li>
            <li>2 cups plain yogurt (Make sure it’s tangy yogurt, Astro Balkan is good if you need a suggestion)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp neutral oil</li>
            <li>½ tsp saffron threads, bloomed in 2 Tbsp hot water</li>
            <li>Salt – ¾ Tbsp per cup of rice (so ~1½ Tbsp total)</li>
            <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups rice (parboiled basmati or long-grain rice, partially cooked, needs to be slightly firm in the center aka al dente)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together egg yolks, yogurt, oil, bloomed saffron, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir in the parboiled rice until well coated.</li>
            <li>Set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Barberries (same for both versions)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup dried barberries</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp bloomed saffron (optional, extra color & aroma)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small pan, heat up some oil and add the barberries. Sauté for 1 minute, then add butter and optional saffron.</li>
            <li>Stir until the barberries get plump then set aside.</li>
        </ol>

    <h4>Chicken Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb (450 g) chicken thighs or breast, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1-2 medium carrots, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>3–4 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
            <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>

        <ol>
            <li>In a pot, place the chicken with carrots, garlic, tomato paste, turmeric, smoked paprika, cumin, mustard, salt, and pepper. Add enough water to just cover the chicken.</li>

            <li>Remove chicken from the broth and shred or cut into smaller pieces. Set aside.</li>
            In a pot, combine chicken, carrot, garlic, spices, and enough water to cover.
        </ol>
    <h4>Stinging Nettle Filling</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 cups nettles (or spinach, kale, or chard), roughly chopped</li>
